Node js :-
---------
While JavaScript and Node. js both use the same language, 
they serve different purposes in the web development ecosystem. 
JavaScript is primarily used for client-side programming, while Node. 
js allows developers to build server-side applications using JavaScript.

why to use Node.js?
--------------------
* Fast & highly scalable
* Asynchonous & Non-blocking
* Light weight and efficient to create HTTP Server
* Same JS programming language for both client & srever
* Very popular for server-side application devlop

Module:-
* Collection js file
*  Each js file have collection of methods  and each method can have parameter.

installiation command:-
 npm init -y
 npm install express

 Node.js - Collection of 3 types of module:-
 *In-bulid module / Core Module
 * 3rd party Module
 * Custom Module

Core Module:-
FS, OS, Path, http

3rd Party Module:-
Express, MongoDB, Mongooes, Url, Mysql

NPM:-
*Centralized Repo for js library
*Used to install 3rd party module
*Installed module - inside node-module folder  


What is Nodemon ?

Nodemon is a tool that helps develop node.js based 
application by automatically vestering the node application
when file changes in the direction.

What is json web token ?

JWT is an open standard (RFC : 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained
way for securly transmitting information between parties as a json object.

What is Express ?

-Node js web framework.
-Opensource framework devloped and maintained by Node.js foundation.
-Express is minimal, fast and flixible node.js web framework, 
 that provides set of featuers for web development.
-Impliment routing, HTTP Server, protocal, Url
-npm install express
***Hapi.js - Best Alternative for express

Why Express ?

-Easily set the backend Api.
-It is very flixible

Node js Api:-

SQL:- (Relation datbase management system)

-We are storing data in the form of tables(Rows and colums)
-Schema based
-Memory wastage very highly

Problem Statement:-
------------------
-New method to manage the flood of data.
-Alternative to relation database management system - sql database
-different from traditional database

What is database ;-
-physical data container
-tables
-rows and colums

MongoDB (Kind of No SQL);-
Opensource document based database management system tool that store data in json like format

featuers of MongoDB :-
-fast -json like -less Memory wastage -Schema less database(optional)
-highly scalable, flixible and distributed
-application driven database
